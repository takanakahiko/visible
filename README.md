**[Try out the web version!](https://visi.dev)**

## Features

- **ðŸ”Ž Validate** â€• You can diagnose your website just by typing the URL.
- **ðŸ¤– Suggestion** â€• Visible is not just a linter, but also provide you a patches to fix the problem by partly using AI platforms.
- **ðŸ¤“ Hackable** â€• Visible supports [plugins](https://github.com/visible/visible/blob/develop/docs/plugin.md) so you can create your own rules or algorithms of suggestion.

## Installation (CLI)

```
npm i @visi/core @visi/cli
```

### Requirements
- Node.js (LTS)
- npm / yarn

By default, `@visi/cli` does not install any rules or drivers. So if you want to use `@visi/plugin-puppeteer` and `@visi/plugin-wcag`, you'd also need:

```
npm i @visi/plugin-puppeteer @visi/plugin-wcag
```

Then, create a `.visiblerc` file. See documentation of [config](https://github.com/visible/visible/blob/develop/docs/config.md) for the detail.

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@visi/plugin-puppeteer",
    "@visi/plugin-wcag",
  ],
  "driver": "@visi/plugin-puppeteer",
  "rules": ["@visi/plugin-wcag"],
}
```

Finally, you can run `visible` command. You can use `--help` to show helps.

```sh
visible --url https://example.com
```
